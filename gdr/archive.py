""" A poor man's archive opener based on GIO.

    archive_open() opens a supported archive and returns a GFile that
    represents its content.  If gvfs-fuse is available, it will have a local
    path as well, otherwise it will be readable through regular GIO calls only.

    archive_close() cleans up when the archive file is not needed anymore.
    After this call neither GIO nor native paths operations are possible.

    This module is problematic in the sense it relies on GIO archive mounts,
    which can be unmounted by anybody, not only the caller.  This means that
    there is no guarantee somebody won't just close the archive on the caller.
    Doing so would lead all operations to fail on the caller, just as if the
    file disappeared. """
